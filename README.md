We are a team of six high-schoolers from Bednarska Szkoła Realna. We take part in international contest – CanSat, organized for over 20 years by ESA (European Space Agency) and CNK (Centrum Nauki Kopernik). The goal of the contest is to build and drop from 2 kilometers a can-sized probe. During and after the landing, the probe must complete two, previously defined, missions staying in touch with the ground station. 

Primary mission depends on measuring pressure, temperature, humidity. We will use this data to: make a 3D model of CanSat's flight, calculate falling speed and compare accelerometer data with height and GPS position. If it turns out to be possible, we will also make a short term weather forecast.

The goal of the secondary mission is to land in a previously chosen by us place, with the possibility to change i during flight of our CanSat, and filming a stabilized video from landing. We chose this mission because it is an interesting challenge for us software and mechanical - wise. The data from the video will help us identify interesting places during landing.



The probe made by us could be used as:

1) relatively cheap and easy to deploy exploration drone, 

2) drone on the alien planet to analyze and document outside conditions
