We are a team of four high-schoolers from Bednarska Szkoła Realna. We take part in an international contest – CanSat, organised for over 20 years by ESA (European Space Agency) and CNK (Centrum Nauki Kopernik). We are the winners of the CanSat 2023 Polish competition, currently competing in the European stage of this contest. The goal of the contest is to build and drop from 2 kilometres a can-sized probe. During and after the landing, the probe must complete two previously defined missions, staying in touch with the ground station.

Primary mission depends on measuring pressure, temperature, humidity. We will use this data to: make a 3D model of CanSat's flight, calculate falling speed and compare accelerometer data with height and GPS position.

The goal of the secondary mission is to land in a previously chosen by us place, with the possibility to change it during flight of our CanSat. We want to achieve this by using a rogallo wing controlled by a servo motor. We chose this mission because it is an interesting challenge for us software and mechanical - wise.


The probe made by us could be used as:

1) relatively cheap and easy to deploy exploration drone,

2) drone on an alien planet to analyse and document outside conditions

3) recovery system for model rockets

4) precise areal package delivery system
